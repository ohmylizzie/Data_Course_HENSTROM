# YOUR REMAINING HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT (Fill in with code) ####

# 1.  Get a subset of the "iris" data frame where it's just even-numbered rows

seq(2,150,2) # here's the code to get a list of the even numbers between 2 and 150
iris_even_numbers <- iris[seq(2, 150, 2), ]

## To view if it worked
View(iris_even_numbers)

# 2.  Create a new object called iris_chr which is a copy of iris, except where every column is a character class
iris_chr <- iris
iris_chr[] <- lapply(iris_chr, as.character)


# 3.  Create a new numeric vector object named "Sepal.Area" which is the product of Sepal.Length and Sepal.Width
Sepal.Area <- iris$Sepal.Length * iris$Sepal.Width

# 4.  Add Sepal.Area to the iris data frame as a new column
iris$Sepal.Area <- Sepal.Area


# 5.  Create a new dataframe that is a subset of iris using only rows where Sepal.Area is greater than 20 
# (name it big_area_iris)
big_area_iris <- subset(iris, Sepal.Area > 20)

## To view if it worked
View(big_area_iris)

# 6.  Upload the last numbered section of this R script (with all answers filled in and tasks completed) 
# to canvas
# I should be able to run your R script and get all the right objects generated
